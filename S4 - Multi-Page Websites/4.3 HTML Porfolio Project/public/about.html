<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my about me section, I am a Computer Science Student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. <br/>
  I am currently in my third year of studies, I am looking forward to learning more about Software Engineering & Web Development. <br />
  I find technology very interesting and I am looking forward to learning new mainstream technology stacks.
</p>

<p>I decided to take Angela Yu's 2024 Web Development Course as I have seen good reviews on it, I find the supplemental learning alongside my degree path will be very helpful in terms of landing internships and future jobs.</p>

<p>I am currently employed at Watershed Carwash serving as a Sales Force Associate. <br/>
My job pertains to informing customers about our unlimited memberships, and trying to turn customers into members. Currently I have generated over $400,000 in annual income from memberships in the San Antonio & New Braunfels districts.
<br /> However, I am looking to pursue internships here soon in Web Development and/or Software Engineering.</p>
