<h1>The Best Movies According to Ryan Hunt</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<!--- Spacing -->
<h3><strong>1.</strong> Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>The plot in this movie is amazing, very funny as well.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> Star Wars: The Force Awakens</h3>
<p>Any star wars movie is great, let's be honest.</p>

<h3><strong>3.</strong> Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Oppenheimer was awesome, while it was very long and I may have missed an hour of it the first time I watched it, it was a really good movie.</p>
